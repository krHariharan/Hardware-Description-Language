# Hardware-Description-Language

This is a collection of projects that were part of the Computer Systems Design coourse, that was conducted in the Fall 2020 semester as part of the CSE curriculum in IIT Madras.

The projects are all based on the Nand2Tetris course and simulators, culminating in designing a simulation of the Hack CPU, so as to gain a fundamental understanding of the logical working of the CPU

Projects of this course were done in groups of 3. My team members were [Jayakamal](https://github.com/jayakamal-geek) and Vishnu Vinod.
